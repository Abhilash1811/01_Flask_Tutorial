- 3.What is the role of the cursor() method in   Python's MySQL database connectivity?

- The cursor() method in Python's MySQL  database connectivity, specifically with  libraries like mysql-connector-python, plays a  vital role in interacting with the database.  Here's a breakdown of its function:

- Creating a Cursor Object:

- When you call cursor() on a MySQL connection   object, it returns a cursor object. This object     acts as an intermediary between your Python  program and the MySQL server.
 Executing Database Operations:

- The cursor object allows you to execute  various database operations, primarily through  the execute() method. You can pass SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) to execute().
Fetching Results (for queries):

- If your SQL statement retrieves data (like a  SELECT query), the cursor object helps you  fetch the results one row at a time or in  batches. It provides methods like fetchone(),  fetchall(), etc., to retrieve data.
